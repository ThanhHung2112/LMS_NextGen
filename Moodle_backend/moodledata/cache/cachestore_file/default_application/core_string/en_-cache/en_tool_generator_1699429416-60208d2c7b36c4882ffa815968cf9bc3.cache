sections, activities, and files.

This is intended to provide a standardised measure for checking the reliability
and performance of various system components (such as backup and restore).

This test is important because there have been many cases previously where,
faced with real-life use cases (e.g. a course with 1,000 activities), the system
does not work.

Courses created using this feature can occupy a large amount of database and
filesystem space (tens of gigabytes). You will need to delete the courses
(and wait for various cleanup runs) to release this space again.

This test plan is designed to work along with {$a}, which makes easier to run the test plan in a specific Moodle environment, gathers information about the runs and compares the results, so you will need to download it and use it's test_runner.sh script or follow the installation and usage instructions.

You need to set a password for the course users in config.php (e.g. $CFG->tool_generator_users_password = 'moodle';). There is no default value for this password to prevent unintended usages of the tool. You need to use the update passwords option in case your course users have other passwords or they were generated by tool_generator but without setting a $CFG->tool_generator_users_password value.

It is part of tool_generator so it works well with the courses generated by the courses and the site generators, it can
also be used with any course that contains, at least:

* Enough enrolled users (depends on the test plan size you select) with the password reset to 'moodle'
* A page module instance
* A forum module instance with at least one discussion and one reply

You might want to consider your servers capacity when running large test plans as the amount to load generated by JMeter
can be specially big. The ramp up period has been adjusted according to the number of threads (users) to reduce this kind
of issues but the load is still huge.

**Do not run the test plan on a live system**. This feature only creates the files to feed JMeter so is not dangerous by
itself, but you should **NEVER** run this test plan in a production site.
