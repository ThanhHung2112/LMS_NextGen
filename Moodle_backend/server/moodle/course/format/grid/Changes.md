History
=============
Version 401.2.0 - 16/08/2023
----------------------------
1. Fix 'Previous/Next section arrows are incorrect for RTL languages' - #183.
2. Fix 'Last section not showing its image when editing'.
3. Convert 'numsections' to 'gnumsections' to facilitate both a course setting and flexible section management when editing.
4. Fix 'Undefined property' - #186.
5. Fix 'No sections showing when creating a course with the default number of sections'.
6. Fix 'Images are missing in the grid boxes when restoring a course' - #172.

Version 401.1.1 - 11/05/2023
----------------------------
1. Fix 'Better way to calculate completion progress' - #180.
2. Fix 'Better scrolling experience using popup Modal' - #179.
3. Improve single section navigation appearance.

2. Show the section image under the section title when editing.

Version 401.0.3 - 16/02/2023

1. Improve popup CSS.
2. Better content handler.

Version 401.0.2 - 03/02/2023
----------------------------
1. Add Modal back, new implementation from the M3.11 version.  Admin setting 'defaultpopup' and course setting 'popup' added,
   default of 'No' and '-' respectively.
2. Add completion indication.  Admin setting 'showcompletiondefault' and course setting 'showcompletion' added, default of 'No'
   and '-' respectively.  Note:  When 'defaultpopup' is being used with this and the popup is closed, the page will refresh.
   This is to allow the indication to be updated.  This solution is not perfect but works and may in future be replaced with
   a far more complicated AJAX one.  However, please do not raise bug issues about it.

Version 401.0.1 - 27/11/2022
----------------------------
1. Release candidate for Moodle 4.1.

Version 400.2.0 - 16/10/2022
----------------------------

2. Fix 'Error during exchange of section pictures' - #168.
3. Fix 'Displayed image not deleted when there are draft area files for a section'.
4. Changed to semantic versioning 2.0.0 (https://semver.org/) for the release value, whereby the 'major' number is the Moodle core
   branch number.  The 'version' property still needs to follow the Moodle way in order for the plugin to operate within the core
   API.

Version 4.0.1.0 - 12/09/2022
----------------------------
1. Tidy and refactor code.
2. More Behat tests.
3. Highlighted section.
4. Improved restore code.

Version 4.0.0.2 - 29/08/2022
----------------------------

Version 4.0.0.1 - 24/08/2022

----------------------------
1. Fix maturity information not showing in information site setting.
2. Fix 'PHP8.0 Compatibility issue when switching to Grid format' - #157.

----------------------------
1. Fix 'Exception when using course import function' - #144.
2. Fix 'Course restore fails with cannotgetimagesforcourse error' - #145.

Version 3.10.1.3 - 02/06/2021
----------------------------
Due to the changes, this is a 'release candidate' release, therefore it is imperative that you test on a test server
first and report any issues back to me please.  Please see the 'Reporting issues' section of the 'Readme.md' file.

1. Rewrite of update of displayed images process, such that should fix #143 when upgrades are conducted on
   staged Moodle installations where there is no data folder.  This also speeds up in general the update process
   as the displayed images are only regenerated when the course is accessed - thus a 'reset all' should be
   much faster.  The downside of all of this is a slower page load for the first user to access a course that has
   had the displayed images updated.
2. Fix backup files do not contain 'alttext' field for the image.

Version 3.10.1.2 - 19/05/2021
----------------------------
1. Fix grid image placement for RTL languages.
2. Fix missing 'set' prefix on 'section0ownpagenogridonesection' causing offset error on course restore.
3. Fix 'PNG files not transparent' - #142.

Version 3.10.1.1 - 12/05/2021
----------------------------
1. Fix 'Site default not applied to setsection0ownpagenogridonesection'.
2. Add new 'single page summary image' functionality (with settings) to show the section image in the section summary on a
   single section page.

Version 3.10.1.0 - 29/03/2021
----------------------------
1. Fix 'Duplicated section name' - #134.
2. All course settings now have an option to track the value of the global default as set by the administrator.  Thus, when they change,
   then the course changes without any user interaction on the course.  The reset course functionality is still there and will
   set the value of the setting to the this 'new' default value.  The default colour value is '-' and the colour picker box will
   show the colour that has been set as the default.  All other settings will state what the default currently is.
3. Fix settings not being reset: 'Greyout hidden' and 'Section 0 on its own page'.
4. Fix incorrect value of 'numsections' when not present in the backup file.
Note: If you see 'Default - {$a}' in a setting dropdown then you need to update core Moodle, please see: MDL-71048.

Version 3.10.0.1 - 14/11/2020
----------------------------

2. Note: Julian has departed from Moodle work so I have taken over full responsibility for the format.

28th March 2014 Version 2.6.1.5
-------------------------------
Change by G J Barnard
1. Fix to RTL CSS thanks to Nadav Kavalerchik - https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-courseformat_grid/pull/3 being:
   Right align "New activity" notification image in RTL mode.
2. Fixed missing strings in 'en' language file for 'One section per page' mode.
3. Fixed number format on ordered lists as reported on https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=252497.
4. Changed current selected image container to #ffc540 from #00cc00.  As the latter was too 'in your face'.
5. Added a new setting so that you can choose if you want to display the "New activity" notification image.  The default is yes.
6. Removed colour and font size attribute of icon text from styles.css.
7. Removed redundant icons.
8. Fixed box-sizing method for Bootstrap V3 in styles.css.
9. Slightly shrunk grid icon outside to make better use of available space.
10. Changed current section colour in the grid to use a box-shadow instead of a background to avoid confusion with
    the current selected section.  This is a compromised as the latter is there for accessibility reasons and hence
    rationally should stand out more.  This change will not be back-ported as it's not IE8 compatible,
    http://caniuse.com/#search=box-shadow and hence requires a version of Moodle that does not mandate it.
11. Fixed CONTRIB-4861 - Glossary pop-ups do not display correctly.

18th December 2013 Version 2.6.1.4
----------------------------------
Change by G J Barnard
1. Fixed path and message confusion issue with the M1.9 upgrade script.
2. Fixed issue reported by Graham Woodsford whereby teachers could not create Collapsed Topics courses.  The code in the area
   concerned is identical to the Grid format and hence the same issue affects it too.  This is because the validation method
   'edit_form_validation' in 'lib.php' was failing the values passed to it.  These happened to be the hidden label values from
   'course_format_options' which were being used because the 'Course creator' role that teachers have before becoming an
   'editingteacher' role as defined in 'db/access.php' does not allow the teacher to have the
   'format/grid:changeimagecontainersize', 'format/grid:changeimageresizemethod' and 'format/grid:changeimagecontainerstyle'
   capabilities.  This also implies that the values of the other settings are wrong, which in fact they are, causing courses to
   be created (after fixing the colour settings for 'edit_form_validation') with odd values and not the defaults resulting in no
   icon set etc.  And therefore needing to go back to edit the course settings.

   Ok, this now leads on to a dilemma.  Currently the course creator role does not have the Grid capabilities listed above.  If
   they were added to 'access.php' then the role would have them (existing Grid admins would have to add manually).  Then the
   teacher would see all the options when first creating a course as they do whilst editing.  However, this means that if you
   wish to restrict the teacher from changing things as is the purpose of the capabilities in the first place, then you have
   to remove the capability in both the 'coursecreator' and 'editingteacher' roles.  This is because by default 'coursecreator'
   is above 'editingteacher' and once enrolled on the course after having created it, the teacher has both.  This makes things
   a bit complex and to be honest not that admin friendly.  Therefore to keep things simple in what is in reality an event
   that is rare, I have decided not to add the capabilities to the 'coursecreator' role.  This is additionally based on the
   presumed work-flow of a teacher where they create the course using the defaults, look at it and then decide what to change
   in the settings.  The fix as it stands will facilitate this.

13th December 2013 Version 2.6.1.3 - Zombie release
---------------------------------------------------
Change by G J Barnard
1. Fixed shade box still being shown in editing mode when update capability is denied.  Historical
   issue that has not been spotted before.  Given http://docs.moodle.org/26/en/Capabilities/moodle/course:update
   I have no idea why that specific capability was in the format for checking editing
   capability in conjunction with actual editing capability in the first place.  Fix
   is to remove the use of it completely which should marginally speed things up a bit.
2. Fixed sections disappearing when the icon is clicked on in editing mode.
3. Fixed icon image eventually disappearing when the section name / summary is changed.  See CONTRIB-4784, a
   big thank you to Nadav Kavalerchik for spotting what was the cause of this and thus providing a reliable
   means of replicating the issue.

26th November 2013 Version 2.6.1.2
----------------------------------
Change by G J Barnard
1. Fix automated backups including displayed images when they should not.
2. Fix 'reset_grid_setting' in 'lib.php' not resetting a course if it's only on default options.
3. Fix restore using the wrong name for the 'image' field.
4. Only delete the old image file if it exists after the new one has been successfully
   created in 'setup_displayed_image' in 'lib.php'.
5. Fix course id set to default for courses created with versions prior to
   13/7/2012 causing an exception to be raised when a section's image record
   cannot be found and yet the record exists already.  This is due to new optimisation
   code relying on using 'courseid' to find the section records for the course in
   one go rather than getting them individually.
6. Ensure a course sets its settings when it is created and then detaches itself from the
   global defaults.

NOTE: I did find in changing the backup / restore code that the changes did not take hold until I
      restarted the web server (in my case the Apache service) if you encounter a situation where
      the automated backup files are larger than the manual ones, then please restart the web server
      service.

The mystery of the disappearing images as reported on: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=244390
by Dan Trockman and by Llywelyn Morgan where overnight the displayed images on old courses
disappear.  This could be caused by the fact that the backup mechanism intentionally removes the displayed
images so that they are not in the backup file which causes issues on restore.  Then the next time the
course is viewed they are automatically regenerated - this is intentional.  But, the automated
functionality calling the code within the format set the course id to '1' being the site course
and not to the course id of the course being backed up (point 1 above addresses this).  And hence
the displayed images for course 1 would be deleted by 'delete_images()', however this would not have
been an issue as there should be no records in the 'format_grid_icon' table for course id '1', but
because of '5' above, old courses had the 'course id' set to '1' and not the true course id of the
course.  And so the method 'delete_images()' deleted them.  This would have been fine as the regeneration
code should have put the images back, but because the code could not find the record containing the image
this did not happen (which '5' above fixes).  But what I cannot explain yet is why with Dan Trockman's
set up the 'database error' ('5') did not manifest itself.  But I hope that fixes '1' and '5' will repair
courses automatically when they are first viewed.  Currently I am unable to work exactly why this
is happening as have been unable to replicate it.  If you encounter the same problem, please let me
know with as much information as possible, like additional add-ons and when you notice it happening.

So, I have decided to release as is as the fixes above are important to distribute to the community.

   the function 'format_grid_delete_course' in 'lib.php' was being called even
   though the course is not in the format and the wrong format object was being
   retrieved.  This then resulted in a method call on a non-existent method.

4th November 2013 Version 2.5.5 - CONTRIB-4099 - BETA
-----------------------------------------------------

12th September 2013 Version 2.5.4.2 - Stable
--------------------------------------------
Change by G J Barnard
1. Changed 'JSON' code in 'module.js' to use the YUI library for JSON to support situations where the 'JSON'
   library is not built into the browser.  Thanks to Colin Taylor for providing information of a situation I
   could not have possibly tested.
Note: If you have already installed V2.5.4 or V2.5.4.1 then this is not an essential upgrade.

--------------------------------------------
Change by G J Barnard

10th September 2013 Version 2.5.4 - Stable
------------------------------------------
Change by G J Barnard
1. Partial implementation of CONTRIB-3240.  Thanks to Andrew Nicols for helping with the YUI module code
   on: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=237275.
   This means that it is now possible to navigate using the keyboard with the 'left' / 'right' cursor keys
   being used to perform previous section / next section respectively and the 'esc' key to toggle open / closed
   the shade box.  As a bonus of this change I've added in navigation arrows to the shade box which appear when
   you hover over the middle of the sides - cool eh?
   Initially I also added Shift-TAB (previous section) / TAB (next section) / Enter (open shade box) /
   Shift-Enter (close shade box) keys to but after much deliberation (and logic issues) I have decided that until
   WIA-ARIA is fully understood I'll leave them out.  Once much more information is known I'll put them back in.
   Also thanks to Enrico Canale and Darren Britten of La Trobe University for their support and information.

   Note:  If you're wondering where the M2.3 and M2.4 versions are, well I intend to release them a few days after
          this M2.5 version so that any bugs that have not been found can be fixed once without having to re-release
          three versions.
2. 'module.js' has been completely reworked so that it is efficient and documented.
3. Added Pirate language.

30th August 2013 Version 2.5.3.3 - Stable

2. Implemented CONTRIB-4579, thanks to all who helped on https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=236075.
3. At the request of Tim St.Clair I've changed the code such that the sections underneath the icons are hidden
   by CSS when JavaScript is enabled so that there is no 'flash' as previously JS would perform the hiding.
4. Added 'Downgrading' instructions above.
5. Added 'Upgrading' instructions above.
6. Added 'Known Issues' above.

22nd August 2013 Version 2.5.3.2 - Stable
