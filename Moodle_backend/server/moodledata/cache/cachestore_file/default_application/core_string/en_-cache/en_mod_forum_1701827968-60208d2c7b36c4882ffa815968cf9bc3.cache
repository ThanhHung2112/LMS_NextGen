There are several forum types to choose from, such as a standard forum where anyone can start a new discussion at any time; a forum where each student can post exactly one discussion; or a question and answer forum where students must first post before being able to view other students' posts. A teacher can allow files to be attached to forum posts. Attached images are displayed in the forum post.

Participants can subscribe to a forum to receive notifications of new forum posts. A teacher can set the subscription mode to optional, forced or auto, or prevent subscription completely. If required, students can be blocked from posting more than a given number of posts in a given time period; this can prevent individuals from dominating discussions.

Forum posts can be rated by teachers or students (peer evaluation). Ratings can be aggregated to form a final grade which is recorded in the gradebook.

Forums have many uses, such as

* A social space for students to get to know each other
* For course announcements (using a news forum with forced subscription)
* For discussing course content or reading materials
* For continuing online an issue raised previously in a face-to-face session
* For teacher-only discussions (using a hidden forum)
* A help centre where tutors and students can give advice
* A one-on-one support area for private student-teacher communications (using a forum with separate groups and with one student per group)
* For extension activities, for example ‘brain teasers’ for students to ponder and suggest solutions to";s:15:"modulename_link";s:14:"mod/forum/view";s:16:"modulenameplural";s:6:"Forums";s:4:"more";s:4:"more";s:11:"movedmarker";s:7:"(Moved)";s:23:"movethisdiscussionlabel";s:50:"Move the current discussion to the specified forum";s:20:"movethisdiscussionto";s:27:"Move this discussion to ...";s:27:"mustprovidediscussionorpost";s:61:"You must provide either a discussion ID or post ID to export.";s:16:"myprofileownpost";s:14:"My forum posts";s:15:"myprofileowndis";s:20:"My forum discussions";s:17:"myprofileotherdis";s:17:"Forum discussions";s:8:"namenews";s:13:"Announcements";s:13:"namenews_help";s:295:"The course announcements forum is a special forum for announcements and is automatically created when a course is created.
