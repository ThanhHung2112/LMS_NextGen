Notes on handling of multiple attempts:

* The option to start a new attempt is provided by a checkbox above the Enter button on the content structure page, so be sure you're providing access to that page if you want to allow more than one attempt.
* Some SCORM packages are intelligent about new attempts, many are not. What this means is that if the learner re-enters an existing attempt, if the SCORM content does not have internal logic to avoid overwriting previous attempts they can be overwritten, even though the attempt was 'completed' or 'passed'.
* The settings "Force completed", "Force new attempt" and "Lock after final attempt" also provide further management of multiple attempts.";s:13:"whatgradedesc";s:131:"Whether the highest, average (mean), first or last completed attempt is recorded in the gradebook if multiple attempts are allowed.";s:5:"width";s:5:"Width";s:6:"window";s:6:"Window";s:20:"youmustselectastatus";s:35:"You must select a status to require";s:4:"info";s:4:"Info";s:19:"displayactivityname";s:21:"Display activity name";s:24:"displayactivityname_help";s:67:"Whether or not to display the activity name above the SCORM player.";}
