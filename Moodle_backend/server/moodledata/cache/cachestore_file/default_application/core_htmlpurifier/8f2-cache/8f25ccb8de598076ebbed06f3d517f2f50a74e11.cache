s:1516:"<p>The glossary activity module enables participants to create and maintain a list of definitions, like a dictionary, or to collect and organise resources or information.</p>

<p>A teacher can allow files to be attached to glossary entries. Attached images are displayed in the entry. Entries can be searched or browsed alphabetically or by category, date or author. Entries can be approved by default or require approval by a teacher before they are viewable by everyone.</p>

<p>If the glossary auto-linking filter is enabled, entries will be automatically linked where the concept words and/or phrases appear within the course.</p>

<p>A teacher can allow comments on entries. Entries can also be rated by teachers or students (peer evaluation). Ratings can be aggregated to form a final grade which is recorded in the gradebook.</p>

<p>Glossaries have many uses, such as</p>

<ul>
<li>A collaborative bank of key terms</li>
<li>A ‘getting to know you’ space where new students add their name and personal details</li>
<li>A ‘handy tips’ resource of best practice in a practical subject</li>
<li>A sharing area of useful videos, images or sound files</li>
<li>A revision resource of facts to remember</li>
</ul>
