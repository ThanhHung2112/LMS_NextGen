s:1136:"<p>The wiki activity module enables participants to add and edit a collection of web pages. A wiki can be collaborative, with everyone being able to edit it, or individual, where everyone has their own wiki which only they can edit.</p>

<p>A history of previous versions of each page in the wiki is kept, listing the edits made by each participant.</p>

<p>Wikis have many uses, such as</p>

<ul>
<li>For group lecture notes or study guides</li>
<li>For members of a faculty to plan a scheme of work or meeting agenda together</li>
<li>For students to collaboratively author an online book, creating content on a topic set by their tutor</li>
<li>For collaborative storytelling or poetry creation, where each participant writes a line or verse</li>
<li>As a personal journal for examination notes or revision (using an individual wiki)</li>
</ul>
