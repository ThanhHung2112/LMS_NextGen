The Grid format story
=====================
The Grid format was originally written by Paul Krix, then taken over by Julian Ridden, and then me in 2012.  It is topics based format that 
uses a grid of user selectable images to pop up a light box of the section.  The format takes time, skill, knowledge and talent to develop.  This 
is why I'm now asking for your financial support in my endeavours.  Without your support, there will no longer be any further major releases of the format.

If you'd like to sponsor, get support or fund improvements, then please do get in touch via:

- gjbarnard | Gmail dt com address.
- GitHub | Please outline your issue / improvement on '[GitHub](https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-format_grid/issues)'.
- @gjbarnard | '[Twitter](https://twitter.com/gjbarnard)'.

Open source software
====================
As the Grid format is licensed under the [GNU GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) License it comes with NO support,
please see 'COPYING.txt'. If you would like support from me then I'm happy to provide it for a fee (please see my contact details
below).  Otherwise, the Moodle '[Courses and course formats](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=47)' forum is an excellent place
to ask questions.

The Grid format can be obtained from:

* [Moodle.org](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=format_grid).
* [GitHub](https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-format_grid/releases).

You have all the rights granted to you by the GPLv3 license.  If you are unsure about anything, then the
FAQ - [GPL FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html) - is a good place to look.

If you reuse any of the code then I kindly ask that you make reference to the format.

If you make improvements or bug fixes then I would appreciate if you would send them back to me by forking from
[GitHub](https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-format_grid/) and doing a 'Pull Request' so that the rest of the Moodle community
benefits.

Required release of Moodle
==========================
This version works with Moodle 4.1 version 2022112800.00 (Build: 20221128) and above within the MOODLE_401_STABLE branch until the
next release.

Please ensure that your hardware and software complies with 'Requirements' in '[Installing Moodle](https://docs.moodle.org/401/en/Installing_Moodle)'.

Reporting issues
================
Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the current release for the major release of Moodle you are using.  It
is essential that you are operating the required release of Moodle as stated above, this is because the format relies on core
functionality that is out of its control.

If you think you've discovered a genuine bug with the format then please look at the Moodle Course and course formats forum first to see if it
has already been repoted.  Secondly, look at [GitHub](https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-format_grid/issues), and thirdly [Moodle Tracker](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB/component/11231).

I operate a policy that I will fix all genuine issues in 'my' (not other developers of the format) code, when fully described and
replicatable.

It is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the format's
version.php file / or the top of the 'Information' settings tab.  Other information such as specific Moodle release, format name and
release also helps.  A screen shot can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.

You can use either the '[Course and course formats forum](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=47)' or '[GitHub](https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-format_grid/issues)'.
